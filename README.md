# Educational Project: Health Bar and UI HUD Creation in Unreal Engine 5 Using C++

In this project, I am focusing on creating a health bar and user interface (UI HUD) in Unreal Engine 5 using C++. This repository serves as an example and provides code to help me understand how to integrate C++ with Unreal Engine's UMG (Unreal Motion Graphics) system.

> **Note:** The project is based on the First-Person C++ template provided by Unreal Engine.


## Project Goals

In this project, I aim to:
- **Implement a Health Bar:** Learn how to create a dynamic health bar that reflects the player's current health status.
- **Design a Functional HUD:** Explore methods for designing and managing a user-friendly HUD that displays important gameplay information.
- **Integrate C++ with UMG:** Understand how to use C++ to control and interact with UI components in Unreal Engine.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:anton-loiko/Strikes.git
   ```
2. **Open the Project:**
   - Launch Unreal Engine 5.
   - Open the project file (.uproject) located in the cloned repository.
3. **Explore the Code:**
   - Navigate through the source files and UI components to see how the health bar and HUD are implemented.
